      title: "Chapter 1: The Activity and Art of Reading"
      lecture_notes: |
        First, read Chapter 1—“The Activity and Art of Reading”—in Mortimer
        J. Adler and Charles Van Doren’s *How to Read a Book.* This chapter
        sets the stage by emphasizing the active nature of reading: rather
        than passively absorbing words, you engage in a conversation with
        the author.

        Once you’ve finished reading, follow the lesson plan below. It is
        designed to reinforce the key ideas from Chapter 1 and help you
        apply them in your own reading habits.

        In this first lesson—derived directly from Chapter 1—we’ll explore
        Adler and Van Doren’s core premise: that reading is an active endeavor.
        Rather than passively receiving words on a page, you’ll learn that
        true reading involves attentive engagement with the text.

        Chapter 1 discusses the difference between reading for entertainment,
        for information, and for understanding. It challenges us to see
        reading not just as a casual pastime but as an art—one that you
        can master through deliberate practice. Adler and Van Doren emphasize
        that to “actively read” means asking questions of both the text and
        yourself, engaging in a two-way conversation with the author.
        
        ## Key Takeaways

        - Reading is considered an active pursuit rather than a passive activity.
        - There are different reasons for reading: entertainment, information, and understanding.
        - A demanding approach to reading fosters deeper comprehension.
        - Developing active reading habits sets the foundation for more advanced reading techniques.
        
        ## Key Concepts

        - **Active Reading:** Viewing reading as a dynamic interaction with the text—asking questions, taking notes, and thinking critically about what you’re reading.
        - **Reading for Entertainment vs. Understanding:** Recognizing that reading “just for fun” differs from reading to learn or to expand your thinking.
        - **Conversation with the Author:** Viewing reading as a dialogue between writer and reader, where questions and reflections are essential to the process.

        ## Key Terms

        - **Active Reading:** The process of engaging with a text, questioning and reflecting on the material, rather than simply absorbing content passively.
        - **Passive Reading:** Reading without much attention or interaction, often leading to limited retention or understanding.
        - **Comprehension:** Understanding the meaning behind the words, concepts, and arguments presented by an author.

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "Why is reading described as an 'active' pursuit?"
          A: "Adler and Van Doren note that true reading involves participation. The reader must engage, question, connect ideas, and respond to the text, rather than merely letting words flow by."
        - Q: "What is meant by 'having a conversation' with the author?"
          A: "It means treating reading like a dialogue: you 'listen' to the author’s ideas, and you respond through note-taking, questioning, and reflecting on your own understanding."
      exercises:
        - name: "Identify the Purpose of Reading"
          prompt: >
            Reflect on your personal reading habits. Which books do you read purely for fun? Which do you read for facts or information? Are there any you read to gain a deeper understanding of a subject?
            List two or three titles and categorize them under these different reasons for reading.
        - name: "A Conversation with the Author"
          prompt: >
            As you read Chapter 1, jot down any questions that come to mind.
            What do you wish you could ask Adler and Van Doren directly about
            their views on active reading? Write these questions in a journal,
            then briefly propose your own best guess at how the authors might respond.

            In your notes, summarize the main points. Pay special attention
            to the idea of reading as a two-way conversation—how do you see
            it playing out in your own approach to reading?
        - name: "Prepare for Chapter 2"
          description: >
            Consider how the principles introduced in Chapter 1 might apply
            to different types of books. In anticipation of Chapter 2, reflect
            on a recent reading challenge—some text you tried to read but
            found difficult to grasp. Note down what happened and how the
            active reading approach might help you overcome such challenges
            in upcoming lessons.

      title: "Chapter 2: The Levels of Reading"
      lecture_notes: |
        This lesson explores the different levels of reading as outlined by
        Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren. The purpose is to recognize that
        not all reading is the same and that different approaches are required
        depending on the depth of engagement with a text.

        ## The Four Levels of Reading

        1. **Elementary Reading:** Basic literacy, the ability to understand words and sentences.
        2. **Inspectional Reading:** A systematic skimming or superficial reading to grasp the main ideas quickly.
        3. **Analytical Reading:** A deeper, more engaged reading process that involves questioning and breaking down the text.
        4. **Syntopical Reading:** Comparing multiple texts on the same subject to form an independent analysis.

        This chapter underscores that most people stop at elementary or inspectional reading, but genuine understanding typically arises only with analytical and syntopical reading. Each level builds on the previous one, and each requires effort and strategy.

        ## Key Takeaways

        - Most people stop at elementary or inspectional reading, missing deeper insights.
        - Analytical reading demands a committed effort to ask questions, challenge ideas, and thoroughly explore the text.
        - Syntopical reading goes even further by relating multiple texts on the same subject.

        ## Key Concepts

        - **Reading as a Spectrum:** From basic comprehension to broad and deep engagement with a text or multiple texts.
        - **Progressive Difficulty:** Each level of reading requires more skill and more active questioning on the reader’s part.
        - **Differentiated Approach:** Not all books should be read with the same level of intensity; some books warrant deeper analysis than others.

        ## Key Terms

        - **Elementary Reading:** The first and most basic level of reading, focusing on decoding words and simple comprehension.
        - **Inspectional Reading:** A high-level skimming process to quickly identify main ideas and decide whether a book warrants deeper reading.
        - **Analytical Reading:** Thorough, in-depth reading aimed at detailed understanding of the text’s structure and arguments.
        - **Syntopical Reading:** The comparison and synthesis of ideas from multiple texts, creating a novel analysis of a subject.
      sources:
        - "Mortimer J. Adler, How to Read a Book, Chapter 2, Sections 1-4"
      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "Why isn’t elementary reading enough for deeper understanding?"
          A: "Elementary reading is just the foundation—decoding words and sentences. To gain deeper insights, you must move beyond comprehension to questioning and analysis."
        - Q: "What is the primary goal of inspectional reading?"
          A: "It helps you quickly determine a book’s main theme and decide whether the book is worth more time for further, deeper reading."
        - Q: "Why do Adler and Van Doren consider syntopical reading the highest level?"
          A: "It demands the most active effort by the reader—comparing and synthesizing multiple authors’ viewpoints to form new insights."
      exercises:
        - name: "Assess Your Reading Level"
          prompt: >
            Reflect on your reading habits. Which level of reading do you
            typically engage in? Do you often stop at understanding the
            surface of a book, or do you dive deeper into its meaning?
        - name: "Practice Inspectional Reading"
          prompt: >
            Choose a non-fiction book and spend 15 minutes practicing
            inspectional reading. Write a brief summary of what you
            learned from the table of contents, headings, and first
            and last paragraphs of chapters.
      assignments:
        - name: "Reading Level Tracker"
          description: >
            Over the next week, keep track of how you engage with different
            texts. Which level of reading are you using? Do you find yourself
            engaging more deeply with certain types of books or articles?
        - name: "Find and Compare Two Books"
          description: >
            Select two books on the same subject and compare how they approach
            the topic—this will engage all the levels of reading at once.
            Try to engage in syntopical reading at a surface level—how do their
            perspectives differ? What new insights emerge from comparing them?

      title: "Chapter 3: The First Level of Reading - Elementary Reading"
      lecture_notes: |
        First, read Chapter 3—“The First Level of Reading: Elementary Reading”
        in Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren’s *How to Read a Book.* This
        chapter focuses on the foundational skills of reading and how they
        develop over time.

        This lesson explores how elementary reading is learned and the stages
        of literacy development. Adler and Van Doren emphasize that many people
        stop improving their reading abilities after reaching basic literacy,
        but true learning requires progressing beyond this level.

        ## Key Takeaways

        - **Elementary reading** is the first level of reading and consists of mastering basic literacy.
        - Reading is developed in **stages**, from recognizing words to full comprehension.
        - Many people remain at this level without advancing to **inspectional, analytical, or syntopical reading**.
        - Effective reading begins with mastering the mechanics of language, but true understanding comes from engaging more deeply.
        - Schools often fail to teach **higher reading skills**, leaving many adults stuck in elementary reading habits.

        ## Key Concepts

        **Stages of Learning to Read:**

        1. **Reading Readiness** – Learning letters, sounds, and basic words.
        2. **Word Mastery** – Recognizing words, sentences, and simple stories.
        3. **Vocabulary Growth** – Expanding word knowledge and using context clues.
        4. **Mature Reading** – Reading for meaning and deeper understanding.

        - **Literacy Development:**
          - The difference between **being able to read** and **reading well**.
          - Many people stop improving their reading ability after school.
          - True literacy involves **reading beyond the surface** of a text.

        - **The Problem with Education:**
          - Schools teach students to read at an elementary level but rarely push beyond it.
          - Advanced reading is necessary for critical thinking and lifelong learning.

        ## Key Terms

        - **Elementary Reading:** The basic ability to recognize and understand words and sentences.
        - **Functional Literacy:** The ability to read and write well enough to function in society.
        - **Comprehension:** Understanding the meaning behind words rather than just recognizing them.
        - **Stages of Literacy:** The progression from basic reading skills to advanced reading ability.

      title: "Chapter 4: The Second Level of Reading - Inspectional Reading"
      lecture_notes: |
        First, read Chapter 4—“The Second Level of Reading: Inspectional
        Reading”—in Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren’s *How to Read
        a Book.* This chapter introduces techniques for **systematic skimming**
        and **superficial reading**, designed to quickly assess a book before
        engaging with it deeply.

        This lesson explores how inspectional reading allows you to determine
        whether a book is worth your time and how to extract essential
        information efficiently.

        ## Key Takeaways

        - Inspectional reading is a **time-efficient** way to grasp the structure and main points of a book before reading it thoroughly.
        - There are **two types** of inspectional reading:
          1. **Systematic Skimming** – Quickly reviewing the title, table of contents, headings, and key paragraphs to get a sense of the book.
          2. **Superficial Reading** – Reading straight through without stopping for deep comprehension, especially for difficult texts.
        - Many people **read inefficiently** by treating all books the same, but not all books require deep analytical reading.
        - Inspectional reading helps identify whether a book **deserves** further reading or should be set aside.

        ## Key Concepts

        - **The Purpose of Inspectional Reading:**
          - Save time by quickly determining a book’s main ideas.
          - Avoid wasting time on books that are not useful or relevant.
        - **Systematic Skimming Techniques:**
          - Read the **title and subtitle** carefully.
          - Examine the **table of contents** to understand the book’s structure.
          - Look at the **index** to identify key topics.
          - Read the **preface and introduction** for the author’s main argument.
          - Skim the first and last paragraphs of each chapter.
        - **Superficial Reading:**
          - Read through the book without stopping to analyze details.
          - Focus on the **flow of ideas** rather than full comprehension.
          - Helps prepare for deeper analytical reading later.

        ## Key Terms

        - **Inspectional Reading:** The process of systematically skimming a book to quickly understand its main ideas.
        - **Systematic Skimming:** A method of previewing a book’s key components before deciding to read it in-depth.
        - **Superficial Reading:** A technique where you read straight through without stopping to analyze difficult sections.
        - **Pre-Reading Techniques:** Strategies to determine a book’s value before committing to reading it fully.

        - Q: "What is a common mistake readers make when approaching books?"
          A: "Treating all books the same and not adjusting their reading strategy to fit the book’s depth."
        - Q: "How does inspectional reading save time?"
          A: "By allowing readers to quickly extract the most important information and decide if further reading is necessary."
        - Q: "Should all books be read analytically?"
          A: "No, some books are not worth deep reading, and some only require inspectional reading."
        - Q: "What should you look for in the table of contents during skimming?"
          A: "The book’s overall structure, main topics, and chapter organization."
        - Q: "Why is it useful to read a book’s introduction and conclusion first?"

      title: "Chapter 5: The Third Level of Reading – Analytical Reading"
      lecture_notes: |
        First, read Chapter 5—“The Third Level of Reading: Analytical Reading”—in
        Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren’s *How to Read a Book.* This chapter
        expands your reading skills beyond the elementary and inspectional levels,
        focusing on a more rigorous and engaged form of reading.

        In **analytical reading**, you apply a systematic method to fully understand
        a book—synthesizing its structure, its main arguments, and its relevance to
        your broader thinking. This is the stage where you make the most demands
        both on yourself and on the author. Through analytical reading, you learn
        not just to extract information, but to deepen your comprehension, ask
        critical questions, and form intelligent judgments about a text.

        The hallmark of analytical reading is its active nature: you cooperate with
        the author—asking questions, challenging points, and thinking carefully
        about implications. You’ll notice a major shift from simpler absorption
        of facts to a more profound exploration of how the text’s arguments and
        perspectives relate to each other—and to the world.

        ## Key Takeaways

        - **Analytical Reading as a Higher-Level Skill**: You move from skimming
          or grasping the general outline of a book to deeply examining the author’s
          arguments. This level is also called “thorough reading” or “reading for
          understanding.”
        - **Active and Systematic Process**: Analytical reading involves structured
          questioning and note-taking to reveal the text’s deeper meaning and
          logical flow.
        - **The Four Basic Questions**: This chapter reminds us that an analytical
          reader seeks answers to four essential questions:
          
          1. *What is the book about as a whole?*
          2. *What is being said in detail, and how?*
          3. *Is the book true, in whole or part?* (Evaluating accuracy)
          4. *What of it?* (Assessing significance)
          
          These questions guide you in drawing out the substance of the text.
        - **Stages of Analytical Reading**:
          1. **Structural Outlining** (reviewing and elaborating on major and minor
            divisions of the text)
          2. **Interpretation** (clarifying the author’s terms, propositions, and
            arguments)
          3. **Criticism/Evaluation** (deciding what’s valid, what’s debatable, and
            how it matters to you)

        ## Key Concepts

        - **Coming to Terms**: Identifying the author’s important words or phrases
          (terms) and understanding how they are uniquely used in the text.
        - **Finding Propositions and Arguments**: Recognizing the author’s statements
          (propositions) and how they fit together to form the book’s overall
          argument or line of reasoning.
        - **Cooperation with the Author**: Treating reading as a dialogue. You follow
          the author’s plan, but also remain critical and engaged, asking questions
          about definitions, evidence, and conclusions.
        - **Evaluation vs. Personal Opinion**: True analytical reading demands
          respect for the text. You suspend immediate judgment until you fully
          grasp the author’s meaning. Then you can accurately evaluate the text’s
          truth and relevance.

        ## Key Terms

        - **Analytical Reading**: A thorough, active approach that seeks to fully
          comprehend the text by identifying structure, clarifying key terms,
          unpacking arguments, and forming a well-considered judgment.
        - **Terms**: Special or “loaded” words an author uses in distinct or
          technical ways. Clarifying these is crucial for correct interpretation.
        - **Propositions**: Declarative statements—“points”—the author makes.
          Identifying these points is central to understanding what the author
          actually argues or concludes.
        - **Arguments**: Chains of reasons that support the author’s propositions.
          Learning to recognize how premises link to a conclusion helps you follow
          (and assess) the logic of the text.

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "What is the main difference between inspectional and analytical reading?"
          A: "Inspectional reading helps you quickly grasp a book’s structure and
              main ideas. Analytical reading, however, goes deeper—evaluating the
              author’s exact use of terms, following arguments, and judging the
              text’s validity and implications."
        - Q: "Why is analytical reading described as 'intensely active'?"
          A: "Because you continuously question, reflect, and challenge both the
              text and yourself. You make notes on key points, clarify ambiguities,
              and form reasoned judgments—rather than passively absorbing words."
        - Q: "What are 'terms,' and why are they important to analytical reading?"
          A: "Terms are pivotal words or phrases that carry the author’s specialized
              meaning. Knowing how these terms are used—and noting shifts in meaning—
              is critical for grasping the author’s arguments accurately."
        - Q: "How do you identify an author’s arguments in a text?"
          A: "Look for propositions linked by words like ‘because,’ ‘therefore,’
              ‘if…then,’ and ‘since….’ These cues show how the author builds support
              for a conclusion or responds to a question."
        - Q: "When should you begin critiquing a book’s arguments?"
          A: "Only after you fully understand them. Adler stresses that you must
              interpret before you criticize—otherwise, your disagreement may stem
              from misunderstanding, not genuine reflection."

      title: "Chapter 6: Interpretation: Terms, Propositions, and Arguments"
      lecture_notes: |
        First, read Chapter 6—“Coming to Terms with an Author”—in Mortimer J. Adler
        and Charles Van Doren’s *How to Read a Book,* and continue through their
        explanation of how to interpret an author’s message—namely, by identifying
        how terms, propositions, and arguments function in a text. Building on the
        principles of analytical reading you studied in the previous lesson, you
        will deepen your ability to discern precisely what an author is saying and
        on what grounds it stands or falls.

        At this point in your growth as a reader, you are no longer just identifying
        the text’s overall structure (as in inspectional reading) or briefly stating
        its central theme. Instead, you are moving inside the architecture of the
        text—locating its load-bearing walls and beams. This is where the details of
        the author’s vocabulary, statements, and logical connections matter. Adler
        and Van Doren sometimes describe this process as “the second stage of
        analytical reading”: coming to terms and propositions, and following
        arguments.

        ## Key Takeaways

        - **From Words to Terms**: Authors typically have a core set of “key words”
          that need special attention if you are to understand their ideas properly.
          A “term” is a word used unambiguously. The same word can have multiple
          meanings in the same text; inversely, different words can convey the same
          underlying concept (term). Identifying these helps align your
          interpretation with the author’s.
        - **From Sentences to Propositions**: Many sentences may sound like claims,
          but only some assert clear, coherent statements that require or admit a
          “true-or-false” evaluation. Distinguishing a mere string of words from a
          definite proposition is key to mapping the text’s real content.
        - **Identifying Arguments**: When propositions are linked logically—e.g.,
          “because…therefore…”—they form an argument. Noticing these link words,
          which indicate reasons and conclusions, allows you to follow and then
          evaluate the author’s reasoning.
        - **Grammar vs. Logic**: Awareness of an author’s diction and syntax is
          essential, but what truly matters is how words and sentences translate
          into concepts and arguments. While grammar is about language structure,
          logic is about thought structure. Being clear on the difference prevents
          literal misunderstandings.

        ## Key Concepts

        - **Technical Vocabulary**: In any serious text, authors have a set of words
          they use in a specialized, often discipline-specific, way. Learning these
          helps you “come to terms” with the author, reducing ambiguity.
        - **Contextual Clues**: Sometimes you spot the meaning of a potentially
          ambiguous word by how it’s used elsewhere in the text, or by the presence
          of synonyms or definitions. This detective work helps ensure you follow
          the author’s single meaning.
        - **Reasoning Cues**: Pay attention to transitions and conjunctions (e.g.,
          “because,” “if…then,” “thus,” “consequently,” “unless”) that reveal how
          the author structures propositions and arrives at conclusions.

        ## Key Terms

        - **Term**: A concept the author uses consistently in a particular sense,
          even if multiple synonyms or various words are used. Terms are central to
          the author’s argument.
        - **Proposition**: A statement that can be judged true or false, expressing
          a specific point the author claims as valid. In reading, identifying
          propositions is crucial for understanding and eventual critique.
        - **Argument**: A chain of propositions linked by reasoning; for example,
          one or more premises lead to a conclusion. Spotting and following an
          argument helps you see how the author supports (or fails to support) the
          main points.

      sources:
        - "Mortimer J. Adler, *How to Read a Book*, Chapter 6"
      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "Why do Adler and Van Doren insist that one word can represent multiple terms?"
          A: "Because words often have different meanings depending on context.
              What seems like a single word might actually carry various
              concepts—especially if an author doesn't use it uniformly."
        - Q: "What is the purpose of identifying 'terms' in a text?"
          A: "By identifying key terms, you ensure that you and the author are
              effectively 'speaking the same language.' It’s how you overcome
              ambiguities and clarify exactly what the author means by a crucial
              concept."
        - Q: "What is the difference between a sentence and a proposition?"
          A: "A sentence is a grammatical unit in language, while a proposition is
              a logical unit of meaning—a claim that can be evaluated as true or
              false. One sentence can actually express multiple propositions, or
              several sentences might convey only one."
        - Q: "How do you recognize an argument in a book?"
          A: "Look for the premises the author sets out (often with words like
              ‘since’ or ‘because’) and see how they are said to lead to a
              conclusion (signaled by words like ‘therefore’ or ‘thus’). This
              structure reveals the chain of logic."
        - Q: "Does interpreting a text end with finding the author’s main terms,
              propositions, and arguments?"
          A: "Interpretation is crucial, but it’s only part of the process. Once
              you understand the text accurately, you must still evaluate and judge
              its validity—whether you agree, disagree, or see limitations. That
              evaluation is the next stage."

      title: "Chapter 7: Determining an Author’s Message"
      lecture_notes: |
        Building on your studies of terms, propositions, and arguments (the basis
        of **interpretive reading**), you are now ready to address a central goal:
        determining the author’s overall message or point. In Mortimer Adler and
        Charles Van Doren’s *How to Read a Book*, this corresponds to moving from
        individual concepts (terms) and claims (propositions) to examining how the
        author weaves these together into a cohesive argument. In other words, you
        need to see how the “main thread” of the book is carried along by arguments,
        supporting evidence, and transitions from one point to another.

        This chapter teaches you to do something essential yet often overlooked:
        distinguishing between the language the author uses (grammar) and what the
        author is actually saying (logic). Grammar and logic are related but not
        identical. Words and sentences can be ambiguous, but once you untangle them,
        the author’s message—expressed as an organized sequence of propositions—must
        stand or fall on the strength of its reasoning.

        ## Key Takeaways

        - **Not All Sentences Contain a Proposition**: An author may include
          exclamations, rhetorical questions, or transitions. Identify which
          sentences genuinely state something you can affirm or deny.
        - **Multiple Propositions in One Sentence**: A sentence can bundle together
          several claims. Your job is to see whether—and how—they link logically.
        - **Arguments: A Roadmap of Reasoning**: Once you see what the author
          asserts (the propositions), look for connectives like “because,” “thus,”
          or “if…then.” These guide you to see how evidence and reasoning form
          a conclusion. This is how you determine the “main line” of the book’s
          argument.
        - **Creating a Coherent Summary**: After breaking down the parts of the
          text, you can reconstruct them, explaining the message in simpler terms
          or an outline. This is crucial for deep comprehension and sets the stage
          for critical judgment.

        ## Key Concepts

        - **Structural vs. Interpretive Reading**: You’ve learned how to outline
          the text’s structure (Chapter 4–5), and how to come to terms with the
          author (Chapter 6). Now you blend these skills to “see” the author’s
          through-line and how each piece of evidence or claim connects.
        - **Levels of Abstraction**: Recognize that different propositions may be
          more general (big ideas) or more specific (examples or explanations).
          Being clear about the level of abstraction helps you place smaller
          details in context.
        - **The Author’s “Voice” vs. The Argument**: Sometimes authors use strong
          language, humorous anecdotes, or emotional appeals. Don’t let that noise
          distract you from what they are actually **arguing**. Peel back the
          rhetorical flourishes to identify core propositions and reasoning.

        ## Key Terms

        - **Declarative vs. Non-Declarative Sentence**: A declarative sentence
          asserts something (e.g., “The sky is blue”), which can be evaluated as
          true or false. By contrast, interrogative, imperative, or exclamatory
          sentences do not strictly present a proposition.
        - **Coherence**: The logical interlinking of ideas or parts of the text.
          Coherence is what allows you to see a set of premises leading to a
          conclusion.
        - **Reconstruction**: The reader’s own process of putting the author’s
          message back together after analyzing it. It’s the final step in
          understanding before you judge.

        - "Mortimer J. Adler, *How to Read a Book*, Chapter 7"
      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "Why do some sentences not express a proposition?"
          A: "Because they may be questions, directives, or emotional expressions
              that aren’t true-or-false statements. Propositions must be
              testable—capable of being affirmed or denied."
        - Q: "How do I identify multiple propositions within a single sentence?"
          A: "Look for logical connectors (‘and,’ ‘or,’ ‘if…then,’ ‘because’). Each
              connector might indicate a separate claim. For instance, ‘If X, then
              Y, but not if Z’ can embed multiple distinct assertions."
        - Q: "What if I find a contradiction in the text?"
          A: "First clarify the author’s terms and context. It may not be a genuine
              contradiction, but if it is, note it. The text’s coherence might be
              weaker, or the author may be introducing a paradox deliberately. Keep
              evaluating how the author resolves it—if at all."
        - Q: "How do I know whether I’ve captured the main argument accurately?"
          A: "Try summarizing it in your own words as a connected sequence of
              premises and a conclusion. If you can’t show how each part leads
              logically to the final point, you might need to refine your
              understanding."
        - Q: "Is determining the author’s message the final step in analytical reading?"
          A: "Not quite. Once you’re sure you understand the author’s main line
              of argument, the next step is evaluating its truth, correctness, or
              significance—i.e., forming a reasoned critique."
