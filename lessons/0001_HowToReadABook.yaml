      title: "Why Reading Matters"
      lecture_notes: |
        This lesson introduces the concept of active reading and explains how
        it differs from passive reading. It highlights the importance of
        intentionality: that good reading is done with purpose, alertness,
        and a willingness to be changed by the text.

        **Key points include:**
        - Reading as an active pursuit (not just background entertainment)
        - How reading shapes thought, knowledge, and character
        - The purpose behind making an effort to read well

      exercises:
        - name: "Reading Reflection"
          prompt: >
            Reflect briefly on your current reading habits. Consider which
            books or articles you choose to read and why. How much time do
            you typically devote? Are you mostly browsing for quick info, or
            reading deeply?

        - name: "Set Your Reading Goals"
          prompt: >
            Write down two or three goals for yourself as a reader. What kinds
            of materials do you want to tackle? Where do you want to grow in
            terms of knowledge or ability?

      assignments:
        - name: "Reading Habit Tracker"
          description: >
            For the coming week, track the time and type of reading you
            do (e.g., social media, novel, textbook). At the end of the week,
            note any observations about your focus, motivation, and how
            purposeful your reading felt.

        - name: "Personal Reading Statement"
          description: >
            Compose a short statement (one paragraph) about why reading
            matters to you personally. Identify at least one concrete benefit
            you hope to gain from more active reading.

      title: "The Levels of Reading"
      lecture_notes: |
        This lesson explores the different levels of reading as outlined by Mortimer
        Adler and Charles Van Doren. The purpose is to recognize that not all reading 
        is the same and that different approaches are required depending on the depth
        of engagement with a text.

        The four levels of reading:
        - **Elementary Reading:** Basic literacy, the ability to understand words and sentences.
        - **Inspectional Reading:** A systematic skimming or superficial reading to grasp the main ideas quickly.
        - **Analytical Reading:** A deeper, more engaged reading process that involves questioning and breaking down the text.
        - **Syntopical Reading:** Comparing multiple texts on the same subject to form an independent analysis.

        **Key takeaways:**
        - Most people stop at elementary or inspectional reading, but true understanding
          requires analytical and syntopical reading.
        - Each level builds upon the previous one.
        - Effective reading is an active process that demands effort and strategy.

      exercises:
        - name: "Assess Your Reading Level"
          prompt: >
            Reflect on your reading habits. Which level of reading do you typically engage
            in? Do you often stop at understanding the surface of a book, or do you dive
            deeper into its meaning?

        - name: "Practice Inspectional Reading"
          prompt: >
            Choose a non-fiction book and spend 15 minutes practicing inspectional reading.
            Write a brief summary of what you learned from the table of contents, headings,
            and first and last paragraphs of chapters.

      assignments:
        - name: "Reading Level Tracker"
          description: >
            Over the next week, keep track of how you engage with different texts. 
            Which level of reading are you using? Do you find yourself engaging more deeply
            with certain types of books or articles?

        - name: "Compare Two Books"
          description: >
            Select two books on the same subject and compare how they approach the topic.
            Try to engage in syntopical reading—how do their perspectives differ? What new
            insights emerge from comparing them?
