      course: |
        ### Part I: Principles

        1. **The Transaction** – Writing is a personal transaction between writer and reader. The more authentic and honest the writer, the stronger the connection.
        2. **Simplicity** – Clear writing begins with clear thinking. Strip sentences down to their cleanest components.
        3. **Clutter** – Most writing is filled with unnecessary words. Eliminate clutter to reveal the meaning.
        4. **Style** – Your style should be natural, not manufactured. It develops by being yourself on the page.
        5. **The Audience** – Write for yourself first. When you enjoy your writing, readers will too.
        6. **Words** – Use precise words. Prefer short, familiar ones over long, vague ones.
        7. **Usage** – Know the rules of grammar and usage well enough to use them (or break them) confidently.

        ### Part II: Methods

        8. **Unity** – Good writing has unity of tone, point of view, and tense.
        9. **The Lead and the Ending** – Start strong to hook readers and end with something that resonates.
        10. **Bits & Pieces** – A collection of writing tips: avoid qualifiers, use active verbs, and vary sentence length.

        ### Part III: Forms

        11. **Nonfiction as Literature** – Nonfiction deserves the same care and craft as fiction.
        12. **The Interview** – The key to a great interview is listening. The writer must shape the material with discretion.
        13. **Writing About People** – Good profiles go beyond facts to reveal personality.
        14. **Writing About Places** – Use specific details to bring locations to life. Show, don’t generalize.
        15. **Memoir** – Memoir is about personal truth. Write honestly, even if events are rearranged.
        16. **Science and Technology** – Write to explain, not to impress. Translate complexity into clarity.
        17. **Business Writing** – Business prose should be human, not bureaucratic. Write with warmth and clarity.
        18. **Sports** – Cover the event, but also the people and stories behind it.
        19. **The Arts** – Criticism is a form of reporting. Write with insight, not just judgment.

        ### Part IV: Attitudes

        20. **The Sound of Your Voice** – Let your personality come through. Be confident and candid.
        21. **Enjoyment, Fear, and Confidence** – Writing is joyful but also scary. Push through fear to gain confidence.
        22. **The Tyranny of the Final Product** – Don’t get stuck striving for perfection. Focus on progress.
        23. **A Writer’s Decisions** – Every sentence is a decision. Be deliberate.
        24. **Write as Well as You Can** – Keep refining. You’re never finished learning how to write.

        ## Overview  
        This week centers on Chapter 1 of *On Writing Well*, where Zinsser explores the personal nature of writing. He argues that writing is not just about conveying information—it's a transaction that reflects the writer’s individuality, honesty, and confidence. Your goal is to be yourself on the page and write with genuine purpose.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Writing is an intimate act of communication between you and the reader.

      title: "Week 3: Simplicity – Writing Clearly"
      course: |
        ## Overview  
        This week explores Chapter 2 of *On Writing Well*, in which Zinsser stresses the power of simplicity. Clear writing stems from clear thinking. Most first drafts contain clutter—unnecessary words that distract and confuse. Your goal this week is to practice writing that is lean, clean, and direct.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Simplicity is the foundation of strong writing.
        - Readers should never struggle to understand your sentences.
        - Complexity in thought does not require complexity in language.

        **Key Concepts**
        - **Simplicity First**: Clear writing begins with eliminating the nonessential.
        - **Reader Respect**: Simplicity values the reader’s time and effort.
        - **Think Before You Write**: If you’re unsure what you mean, your writing will show it.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Clarity**: The quality of being easily understood.
        - **Economy of Language**: Using the fewest words necessary to make a point.
        - **Obfuscation**: The act of making writing unnecessarily complicated or confusing.

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "Why is simplicity so hard to achieve in writing?"
          A: "Because we often think in vague or cluttered ways—and we tend to write as we think. Simplicity requires clarity of thought and discipline."
        - Q: "What is the writer’s responsibility when it comes to clarity?"
          A: "To ensure the reader never has to work to understand the meaning. The burden is on the writer, not the reader."

      title: "Week 4: Clutter – Cutting the Unnecessary"
      course: |
        ## Overview  
        In Chapter 3 of *On Writing Well*, Zinsser targets the most common enemy of clarity: clutter. Clutter is the buildup of unnecessary words, passive constructions, vague modifiers, and jargon. This week, you’ll practice spotting and eliminating clutter to make your prose more powerful and readable.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Clutter weakens writing by hiding meaning behind needless words.
        - Most first drafts are cluttered—it’s your job to clean them up.
        - Strong writing is lean, direct, and purposeful.

        **Key Concepts**
        - **The Enemy of Clarity**: Clutter creates fog—remove it to reveal meaning.
        - **Editing as Discovery**: You often find your real meaning in the act of trimming.
        - **Precision Over Padding**: Exact words carry more force than vague embellishment.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Clutter**: Unnecessary words or phrases that cloud meaning.
        - **Redundancy**: Saying the same thing more than once without adding value.
        - **Passive Voice**: A form that often leads to indirect, cluttered writing.

      sources:
        - "Zinsser, W. (2006). On Writing Well. Chapter 3: Clutter."
        - "Course outline 'Week 4: Clutter – Cutting the Unnecessary'."

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "What does Zinsser recommend as the first act of revision?"
          A: "To strip every sentence down to its cleanest components—eliminating unnecessary words, phrases, and qualifiers."
        - Q: "Why is clutter so common in writing?"
          A: "Because we often think cluttered thoughts or believe longer sentences sound more intelligent or professional."

      exercises:
        - name: "Clutter Cut (Easy)"
          prompt: >
            Take a 3–4 sentence paragraph and reduce it to a single, clean sentence without losing meaning. Share both versions.

          prompt: >

      title: "Week 5: Style – Finding Your Voice"
      course: |
        ## Overview  
        In Chapter 4 of *On Writing Well*, Zinsser addresses style—not as decoration, but as the natural expression of the writer’s personality. True style arises from confidence, simplicity, and an honest voice. This week, you’ll learn to recognize your voice and begin to trust it.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Style grows from honesty, not affectation.
        - You already have a voice—refine it rather than imitate others.
        - Confidence leads to style; fear leads to overcompensation.

        **Key Concepts**
        - **Style is You**: Good style comes from being natural, not literary.
        - **Imitation vs. Individuality**: Don’t write to sound like someone else.
        - **Courage to be Plain**: Simpler, truer writing feels riskier—but it connects.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Style**: The individual way you express ideas in writing.
        - **Authenticity**: Staying true to your personality and values in voice.
        - **Pretension**: A forced or artificial tone that distances readers.

        - Q: "How does Zinsser define 'style' in writing?"
          A: "Style is who you are—your natural voice on the page, without pretension or artificiality."
        - Q: "Why is simplicity often mistaken for weakness in writing?"
          A: "Because people wrongly believe that complex, ornate language sounds smarter—when it often hides weak thinking."

      course: |
        ## Overview  
        In Chapter 5, Zinsser argues that writers should stop worrying about “the audience.” Write for yourself first, and clarity will follow. This week, you’ll explore the balance between staying true to your voice and writing in a way others can understand.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Don't write to please an imaginary audience.
        - Clear thinking leads to writing that others can follow.

        - **Empathy vs. Pandering**: Consider the reader’s experience, but don’t compromise your voice.
        - **Clarity as a Bridge**: When you think clearly, readers will follow.

        - Q: "How can worrying about the reader weaken your writing?"
          A: "You’ll start second-guessing yourself, overexplaining, or trying to sound impressive rather than being clear and honest."

        **Key Takeaways**

Chapters 11–13 of *On Writing Well* explore how to listen well, capture voices truthfully, and evoke a place through detail and observation. Your job this week is to tell a story through someone else—or somewhere else.

        - Travel writing is more than listing scenery—it’s about people, context, and experience.

In Chapters 21–23, Zinsser explores the emotional and practical realities of revision—overcoming fear, resisting perfectionism, and learning to make good decisions sentence by sentence. This week, you’ll practice editing as a creative act, not a mechanical one.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - First drafts are only the beginning—great writing is sculpted in revision.
        - Editing requires both detachment and precision.
        - Confidence comes from rewriting, not inspiration.
