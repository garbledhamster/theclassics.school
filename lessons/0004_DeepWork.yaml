title: "Week 1: Introduction — What Deep Work Is and Why It Matters"
overview: |
This week establishes the course foundation: what “deep work” is, how it differs from shallow work, and why the ability to focus is becoming both rarer and more valuable.
You’ll set a baseline for your current attention, identify your biggest focus leaks, and define one concrete outcome you want deep work to help you achieve during the course.
  keys:
    takeaways:
      - "Deep work is a skill that can be trained with structure, not a personality trait."
      - "Shallow work expands to fill time unless you set explicit boundaries."
      - "A clear target and baseline make improvement measurable and motivating."
    concepts:
      - "Distraction-free concentration"
      - "Skill-building through deliberate practice"
    terms:
      - "Deep work: cognitively demanding work done with full concentration that creates new value or improves skill."
      - "Shallow work: logistical or low-cognitive tasks that are easy to replicate and often performed while distracted."

  sources:
    - "Primary Text: Deep Work (Cal Newport), Introduction"
    - "Supporting Reading: Attention residue and task-switching overview (research summary source of your choice)"

  questions_and_answers:
    - Q: "What makes deep work different from simply 'working hard' for long hours?"
      A: "Deep work requires sustained, distraction-free concentration on demanding tasks; long hours can still be shallow if they are fragmented by switching, messaging, and reactive work."
    - Q: "Why start with a baseline instead of jumping straight into tactics?"
      A: "Because focus problems are often invisible without measurement; a baseline helps you target the right constraints and track progress objectively."

  exercises:
    - name: "Define Your Deep Work Target"
      difficulty: "Easy"
      prompt: |
        Choose one meaningful output you want deep work to produce by Week 16 (e.g., a certification study plan completed, a portfolio project shipped, a writing series drafted).

  title: "Week 2: Chapter 1 — Deep Work Is Valuable"
  overview: |
    This week covers the core economic argument: in a fast-changing, technology-shaped world, the ability to learn complicated things quickly and produce at an elite level is a competitive advantage.
    You’ll translate that argument into your own context by identifying high-leverage skills and creating a “deep work value chain” linking deep focus to tangible outcomes.

  keys:
    takeaways:
      - "Deep work increases your rate of learning and the quality of your output."
      - "Value comes from rare skills paired with the ability to produce valuable things."
      - "The best deep work strategy is tied to your actual goals, not generic productivity."
    concepts:
      - "High-leverage skills"
      - "Deliberate practice as focus training"
    terms:
      - "Deliberate practice: structured training with clear goals and feedback to improve performance."
      - "High-leverage output: work that disproportionately advances goals relative to time spent."

  sources:
    - "Primary Text: Deep Work (Cal Newport), Chapter 1"
    - "Supporting Reading: Deliberate practice basics (Anders Ericsson overview source of your choice)"

  questions_and_answers:
    - Q: "How does deep work make you better at learning hard things?"
      A: "Focused concentration reduces task switching, enabling sustained cognitive strain and feedback—conditions needed for skill acquisition."
    - Q: "What’s the practical link between deep work and career value?"
      A: "Deep work helps you build rare skills and produce higher-quality results, which makes your work harder to replace and more rewarded."

  title: "Week 3: Chapter 2 — Deep Work Is Rare"
  overview: |
    This week examines why deep work is increasingly uncommon: open offices, constant connectivity, and a culture that rewards visible responsiveness over real output.
    You’ll diagnose the specific forces that push you into shallow work and build a realistic plan to protect focus within your constraints.

  keys:
    takeaways:
      - "Many workplaces unintentionally optimize for reactivity, not results."
      - "If you don’t defend your attention, someone else will spend it for you."
      - "The solution is systems and agreements, not heroic willpower."
    concepts:
      - "Busyness as proxy for productivity"
      - "Attention fragmentation"
    terms:
      - "Attention fragmentation: splitting focus across many small tasks that prevents sustained progress."
      - "Reactive workflow: a mode of working driven by incoming messages and requests rather than planned priorities."

  sources:
    - "Primary Text: Deep Work (Cal Newport), Chapter 2"
    - "Supporting Reading: Context switching costs (research summary source of your choice)"

  questions_and_answers:
    - Q: "Why does ‘being busy’ often feel productive even when it isn’t?"
      A: "Because responsiveness produces immediate feedback and visible activity, while deep progress is slower, quieter, and harder to measure moment-to-moment."
    - Q: "What’s a realistic approach when your job requires responsiveness?"
      A: "Batch and bound reactivity—create windows for shallow work and protect pre-committed deep blocks with clear expectations."

  exercises:
    - name: "Shallow Pressure Audit"
      difficulty: "Easy"
      prompt: |
        Identify the top 5 sources of shallow pressure in your life/work (email, chat, meetings, urgent requests, social feeds).

  title: "Week 4: Chapter 3 — Deep Work Is Meaningful"
  overview: |
    This week focuses on the psychological and philosophical case: deep work can create satisfaction, craftsmanship pride, and a sense of meaning that shallow work rarely provides.
    You’ll connect deep work to your values and design a motivation strategy that makes focus feel worth protecting.

  keys:
    takeaways:
      - "Meaning increases when you invest full attention into challenging work."
      - "Craftsmanship is a mindset: focus on quality, process, and improvement."
      - "A compelling ‘why’ makes deep work sustainable during hard weeks."
    concepts:
      - "Craftsmanship mindset"
      - "Flow-supporting conditions"
    terms:
      - "Craftsmanship: valuing skill, quality, and care in how work is done."
      - "Flow: a state of absorption where challenge and skill are well-matched and attention is fully engaged."

  sources:
    - "Primary Text: Deep Work (Cal Newport), Chapter 3"
    - "Supporting Reading: Flow overview (Csikszentmihalyi summary source of your choice)"

  questions_and_answers:
    - Q: "Why can shallow work feel draining even when it’s easy?"
      A: "Because it often lacks clear progress, meaningful challenge, and closure—leading to low satisfaction despite constant activity."
    - Q: "How does the craftsmanship mindset change motivation?"
      A: "It shifts attention from external validation to controllable process and quality, making effort feel purposeful."

  exercises:
    - name: "Meaning Map"

  title: "Week 5: Rule #1 — Work Deeply (Part A): Choose Your Depth Philosophy"
  overview: |
    This week begins the practical rules. You’ll learn the main “depth philosophies” for scheduling deep work (different ways to structure time) and choose one that fits your real constraints.
    You’ll build your first repeatable weekly cadence for deep sessions that you can maintain beyond motivation spikes.

  keys:
    takeaways:
      - "A depth philosophy is a scheduling strategy that makes deep work repeatable."
      - "The best philosophy fits your role constraints and energy patterns."
      - "Consistency beats intensity when building a long-term habit."
    concepts:
      - "Time-structuring strategies"
      - "Habit formation through scheduling"
    terms:
      - "Depth philosophy: a chosen approach to regularly scheduling deep work (e.g., monastic, bimodal, rhythmic, journalistic)."

  sources:
    - "Primary Text: Deep Work (Cal Newport), Rule #1: Work Deeply (Depth philosophies section)"
    - "Supporting Reading: Habit cues and routines (habit formation summary source of your choice)"

  questions_and_answers:
    - Q: "How do you choose the right depth philosophy?"
      A: "Match it to your constraints (meetings, on-call, caregiving), then pick the simplest structure you can actually repeat every week."
    - Q: "Why is scheduling central to deep work?"
      A: "Because deep work is easily displaced by urgent shallow tasks; scheduling turns intention into a protected commitment."

  exercises:
    - name: "Constraint Snapshot"
      difficulty: "Easy"
      prompt: |
        List your fixed commitments for a typical week (meetings, shifts, family, commutes).

  title: "Week 7: Rule #1 — Work Deeply (Part C): Execute Like a Business and Be Lazy"
  overview: |
    This week adds execution discipline: track what you do, set lead measures, and review results like a business would.
    You’ll also implement intentional downtime and a shutdown routine to protect long-term focus and prevent attention from leaking into the evening.

  keys:
    takeaways:
      - "Tracking and review turn deep work into a managed process."
      - "Downtime supports better deep work by enabling recovery and insight."
      - "A shutdown ritual reduces rumination and protects rest."
    concepts:
      - "Lead measures and weekly review"
      - "Recovery and cognitive rest"
    terms:
      - "Lead measure: a behavior you can control (hours of deep work) that predicts results."
      - "Shutdown ritual: a consistent end-of-day process that closes loops and signals work is done."

  sources:
    - "Primary Text: Deep Work (Cal Newport), Rule #1: Work Deeply (Execute Like a Business; Be Lazy sections)"
    - "Supporting Reading: Recovery and performance basics (sports/learning recovery summary source of your choice)"

  questions_and_answers:
    - Q: "What should you measure to make deep work consistent?"
      A: "Measure deep work time and deep work outputs; use weekly review to connect time invested to concrete artifacts."
    - Q: "Why does downtime improve deep work instead of reducing productivity?"
      A: "Rest restores attention, reduces fatigue-driven distraction, and allows subconscious problem-solving to continue."

  exercises:
    - name: "Define Your Lead Measures"
      difficulty: "Easy"
      prompt: |
        Choose two lead measures (e.g., deep hours/week, sessions/week, pages/week, problems solved/week).

  title: "Week 8: Rule #2 — Embrace Boredom (Part A): Train Focus, Don’t Feed Distraction"
  overview: |
    This week builds concentration as a trainable skill by reducing the habit of reaching for stimulation whenever boredom appears.
    You’ll implement structured breaks and practice staying with discomfort, so deep work becomes easier to sustain.

  keys:
    takeaways:
      - "If you constantly escape boredom, you weaken your ability to concentrate."
      - "Scheduling breaks from focus is better than taking breaks from distraction."
      - "Training attention requires repeated exposure to “nothing happening” without escaping."
    concepts:
      - "Attention training"
      - "Impulse control through structure"
    terms:
      - "Boredom tolerance: the ability to remain present without seeking quick stimulation."
      - "Distraction reflex: an automatic urge to check something when effort or uncertainty appears."

  sources:
    - "Primary Text: Deep Work (Cal Newport), Rule #2: Embrace Boredom"
    - "Supporting Reading: Habit loop basics (cue-craving-response summary source of your choice)"

  questions_and_answers:
    - Q: "Why does embracing boredom help deep work?"
      A: "Because deep work requires sustained attention; boredom training weakens the reflex to flee effort through quick hits of stimulation."

  title: "Week 9: Rule #2 — Embrace Boredom (Part B): Productive Meditation and Intensity"
  overview: |
    This week adds specific training techniques Newport recommends to strengthen concentration under real-world conditions.
    You’ll practice productive meditation (thinking deeply while doing a physical activity) and increase intensity with tight time constraints and clear objectives.

  keys:
    takeaways:
      - "Productive meditation trains sustained thought without external input."
      - "Intensity improves when you limit time and force focus on a defined objective."
      - "Cognitive training should be repeated and measured like physical training."
    concepts:
      - "Productive meditation"
      - "Time-boxed intensity"
    terms:
      - "Productive meditation: focusing on a single professional problem while doing a physically simple activity."
      - "Time-box: a fixed time limit that increases urgency and reduces wandering."

  sources:
    - "Primary Text: Deep Work (Cal Newport), Rule #2: Embrace Boredom (Productive meditation and training sections)"
    - "Supporting Reading: Time constraints and Parkinson’s Law overview (summary source of your choice)"

  questions_and_answers:
    - Q: "How is productive meditation different from daydreaming?"
      A: "It’s deliberate: you choose one problem, return to it when your mind wanders, and avoid switching topics."
    - Q: "Why do tight deadlines sometimes increase quality?"
      A: "They reduce room for dithering, encourage prioritization, and force your mind to stay with the core problem."

  exercises:
    - name: "Pick a Meditation Problem"
      difficulty: "Easy"

  title: "Week 10: Rule #3 — Quit Social Media (Part A): The Law of the Vital Few for Tools"
  overview: |
    This week applies a disciplined approach to network tools: evaluate them based on whether they significantly support what you value, not whether they offer any benefit at all.
    You’ll define your high-level goals and systematically assess which tools truly help, then design replacements for the value you fear losing.

  keys:
    takeaways:
      - "Most tools offer some benefit; the key is whether they provide major benefits relative to costs."
      - "Define what you’re optimizing for before evaluating tools."
      - "Replace tool benefits with intentional alternatives to reduce fear-based retention."
    concepts:
      - "Cost-benefit tool evaluation"
      - "Vital few vs trivial many"
    terms:
      - "Law of the vital few: a small number of inputs drive most outcomes; prioritize tools with outsized benefits."
      - "Any-benefit trap: keeping a tool because it has some upside, ignoring its attention costs."

  sources:
    - "Primary Text: Deep Work (Cal Newport), Rule #3: Quit Social Media"
    - "Supporting Reading: Pareto principle overview (summary source of your choice)"

  questions_and_answers:
    - Q: "What’s wrong with keeping tools that have ‘some’ benefit?"
      A: "Because the hidden cost is attention fragmentation; small benefits rarely justify a constant drain on focus and time."
    - Q: "How do you evaluate a tool rigorously?"
      A: "Start with your goals, list activities that support them, then keep only tools that strongly support those activities with minimal cost."

  exercises:
    - name: "Define Two High-Level Goals"
      difficulty: "Easy"
      prompt: |
        Define two high-level goals for the next 6–12 months (career, learning, health, relationships).

  title: "Week 11: Rule #3 — Quit Social Media (Part B): The 30-Day Mindset and High-Quality Leisure"
  overview: |
    This week reinforces a key idea: reducing network tools only works if you fill the space with better alternatives.
    You’ll design high-quality leisure and practice being intentional about relaxation so your attention can recover rather than get trapped in low-value scrolling.

  keys:
    takeaways:
      - "Removing distraction creates a vacuum; high-quality leisure prevents relapse."
      - "Intentional leisure restores energy and supports deep work sustainability."
      - "A clear leisure plan reduces boredom-driven tool use."
    concepts:
      - "High-quality leisure"
      - "Intentional replacement habits"
    terms:
      - "High-quality leisure: activities that are engaging, skillful, or socially meaningful, not passive default consumption."
      - "Default behavior: what you do when you haven’t planned; often driven by convenience and habit."

  sources:
    - "Primary Text: Deep Work (Cal Newport), Rule #3: Quit Social Media (leisure emphasis)"
    - "Supporting Reading: Leisure and recovery basics (summary source of your choice)"

  questions_and_answers:
    - Q: "Why does high-quality leisure matter for deep work?"
      A: "Because attention is finite; better leisure restores it, while low-quality leisure often prolongs distraction habits."
    - Q: "How do you avoid replacing social media with another time sink?"
      A: "By scheduling leisure intentionally and choosing activities with clear start/stop points and meaningful engagement."

  exercises:

  title: "Week 12: Rule #4 — Drain the Shallows (Part A): Identify and Quantify Shallow Work"
  overview: |
    This week focuses on reducing shallow work by first making it visible and measurable.
    You’ll conduct a shallow work audit, estimate the “depth value” of tasks, and begin shifting your schedule so deep work becomes the default.

  keys:
    takeaways:
      - "You can’t reduce shallow work you don’t track."
      - "Many shallow tasks feel urgent but don’t meaningfully move goals."
      - "Quantifying time and value helps you negotiate boundaries with evidence."
    concepts:
      - "Time auditing"
      - "Task value estimation"
    terms:
      - "Shallow audit: a structured review of shallow tasks to understand their volume and drivers."
      - "Depth value: an estimate of how much a task contributes to long-term outcomes relative to its time cost."

  sources:
    - "Primary Text: Deep Work (Cal Newport), Rule #4: Drain the Shallows"
    - "Supporting Reading: Time tracking and prioritization basics (summary source of your choice)"

  questions_and_answers:
    - Q: "Why do shallow tasks multiply so quickly?"
      A: "Because they are easy to start, provide quick closure, and are often socially rewarded, so they crowd out planned deep work."
    - Q: "How do you decide what shallow work to cut?"
      A: "By comparing its true value to its time and attention cost, then eliminating, batching, automating, or renegotiating low-value items."

  exercises:
    - name: "Shallow Work Log"
      difficulty: "Easy"
      prompt: |
        For two days, log shallow tasks in categories (email, chat, meetings, admin, browsing).

  title: "Week 13: Rule #4 — Drain the Shallows (Part B): Schedule Every Minute and Become Hard to Reach"
  overview: |
    This week operationalizes shallow control with two tactics: planning time with intention (so shallow doesn’t sprawl) and reshaping communication so you aren’t constantly interruptible.
    You’ll build a daily planning method, define email/message protocols, and create response templates that protect deep blocks without dropping responsibilities.

  keys:
    takeaways:
      - "Minute-level planning reveals tradeoffs and prevents accidental shallow sprawl."
      - "Communication systems can reduce back-and-forth dramatically."
      - "Being harder to reach is about clarity and batching, not ignoring people."
    concepts:
      - "Time-block planning"
      - "Asynchronous communication design"
    terms:
      - "Time-block plan: a day plan that assigns blocks to activities, updated as reality changes."
      - "Process-centric email: messages that propose a clear next step to reduce back-and-forth."

  sources:
    - "Primary Text: Deep Work (Cal Newport), Rule #4: Drain the Shallows (schedule every minute; become hard to reach sections)"
    - "Supporting Reading: Asynchronous communication practices (summary source of your choice)"

  questions_and_answers:
    - Q: "Do you have to follow a time-block plan perfectly for it to work?"
      A: "No—its value is in making choices explicit; you revise the plan when things change instead of drifting into reactive mode."
    - Q: "How do you reduce email without missing important work?"
      A: "Batch message processing, use clearer next-step proposals, and set expectations for response times and escalation paths."

  title: "Week 16: Integration (Capstone Part B) — Execute, Review, and Lock In the Habit"
  overview: |
    This final week is execution and consolidation: complete multiple capstone deep sessions, assemble your final artifact, and evaluate your deep work system with evidence.
    You’ll finish with a post-course operating plan that keeps deep work alive without needing the course structure.

  keys:
    takeaways:
      - "Execution validates the system; review makes it sustainable."
      - "Evidence-based reflection improves your deep work design faster than guesswork."
      - "A maintenance plan prevents backsliding into shallow default."
    concepts:
      - "Retrospective analysis"
      - "Maintenance planning"
    terms:
      - "Retrospective: a structured review of what worked, what didn’t, and what to change next cycle."
      - "Maintenance plan: a lightweight ongoing routine that preserves deep work habits long-term."

  questions_and_answers:
    - Q: "What’s the most important measure of success at the end of the course?"
      A: "A working, repeatable deep work system that produces artifacts consistently—not perfection or never being distracted."
    - Q: "How do you keep deep work going when motivation fades?"
      A: "Use minimal viable cadence, scheduled blocks, clear rules, and a weekly review that reconnects deep work to outcomes."

  exercises:
    - name: "Capstone Execution Sprint"
      difficulty: "Easy"
