      title: "Guiding Questions by Book"
      course: |
        Use these prompts alongside the readings to steer note-taking and discussion.

        #### Book I — Happiness & the Function Argument
        - What does Aristotle mean by the “chief good,” and why must it be **complete** and **self-sufficient**?
        - Reconstruct the function (ergon) argument step by step. Where are its vulnerable points?
        - How does the distinction between **living**, **perceiving**, and **rational activity** ground the definition of happiness?

        #### Book II — Virtue as Habit and the Mean
        - Why are virtues **states** rather than feelings or capacities?
        - How does habituation train perception of the mean? What role do pleasure and pain play?
        - Pick two virtues (e.g., courage, generosity) and plot the excess/deficiency mean for each.

        #### Book III — Choice, Deliberation, Courage, Temperance
        - How does Aristotle distinguish **choice** (prohairesis) from wish or impulse?
        - When is an act voluntary, mixed, or involuntary? What examples test the boundaries?
        - What makes courage distinct from rashness and cowardice? How does temperance regulate bodily pleasures?

        #### Book IV — The Finer-Grained Virtues
        - What unifies generosity, magnificence, and magnanimity? How do they relate to honor and wealth?
        - How do wit and friendliness express virtue in social interaction? Where is the mean for anger?

        #### Book V — Justice
        - Differentiate **universal justice** (lawfulness) from **particular justice** (distributive and corrective).
        - How does geometric vs. arithmetic proportion structure Aristotle’s account of fairness?
        - What role do equity and the equitable person play when law is too general?

        #### Book VI — Intellectual Virtues
        - Contrast **prudence (phronēsis)** with **wisdom (sophia)**; why is prudence essential to moral virtue?
        - How do **nous**, **technē**, and **epistēmē** differ in their relation to universals and particulars?
        - Why can’t someone be prudently akratic? What does this imply about practical reason?

        #### Book VII — Continence & Pleasure
        - What is Aristotle’s diagnosis of **akrasia** (incontinence)? How does it differ from vice?
        - Why does he reject simple hedonism yet defend pleasure’s role in the good life?

        #### Books VIII–IX — Friendship
        - Distinguish friendships of **utility**, **pleasure**, and **virtue**. Why is the third the most stable?
        - How do friendships mirror the self? What is the role of goodwill and reciprocity?
        - Can unequal friendships (e.g., parent–child) still be just? How?

        #### Book X — Pleasure & Contemplation
        - How does Aristotle refine his account of pleasure? Why link it to **activity** rather than static states?
        - Why is contemplative activity proposed as the highest happiness? Do you agree?

      title: "Weekly Assignments & Practices"
      course: |
        Each week pairs a focused practice with a brief writing task. Keep all notes in a single notebook to track growth.

        - **Week 1 (Book I):** Write a 250-word explanation of the **function argument** in your own words; include one objection.
        - **Week 2 (Book II):** Keep a **virtue log** for three days, noting moments of excess/deficiency and attempts to steer to the mean.
        - **Week 3 (Book III):** Draft a decision tree for one hard choice you face; label voluntary and mixed factors.
        - **Week 4 (Book IV):** Observe a public interaction (live or recorded). Identify instances of wit, friendliness, or anger at a mean.
        - **Week 5 (Book V):** Analyze a recent news story for issues of distributive or corrective justice. Write 200 words on what “fair” would mean in Aristotle’s terms.
        - **Week 6 (Book VI):** Compose a **prudence checklist** for recurring decisions (money, time, relationships). Test it once and revise.
        - **Week 7 (Book VII):** Document one episode of temptation. Narrate your reasoning, feelings, and whether you acted continently or akratically.
        - **Week 8 (Books VIII–IX):** Schedule and execute one action that strengthens a virtue-based friendship. Reflect on reciprocity and shared activity.
        - **Week 9 (Book X 1–8):** Write a 300-word reflection evaluating Aristotle’s case for contemplation as the highest happiness.
        - **Week 10 (Book X 9):** Draft a one-page “mini-code” of laws for your personal or team life. Include habituation practices and penalties/rewards.

        **Capstone (optional):** Produce a 3–4 page essay synthesizing Aristotle’s account of virtue, friendship, and contemplation, with one modern application (e.g., workplace ethics, digital habits, community life).

        **Assessment:** Completion is based on weekly writings and application exercises, not quizzes. Share highlights with a partner or study group for accountability.

        - Reconstruct each step of the function argument.
        - Distinguish lives of pleasure, honor, wealth, and contemplation.

        **Discussion & Notes**
        - What does Aristotle mean by “activity of soul in accord with virtue”? How does this relate to a human function?
        - Where could the function argument be challenged? (e.g., does “function” apply to humans?)
        - How does political science frame the inquiry into happiness?

        **Exercises**

        2. List three popular candidates for the good life (wealth, honor, pleasure) and Aristotle’s objections to each.
        3. Identify one activity in your week that expresses deliberate reason; explain how virtue could shape it.

        **Writing (250–300 words)**: Define eudaimonia in your own words using Aristotle’s terms. Add one objection you find plausible.

    - lesson_id: 2
      title: "Week 2 – Virtue, Habit, and the Mean (Book II 1–9)"
      course: |
        **Reading**: Book II (entire). Aristotle’s account of moral virtue, habituation, and the doctrine of the mean.

        **Goals**

        **Exercises**
        1. Create a two-column chart of **five virtues** with their excess and deficiency (e.g., Courage ↔ rashness/cowardice).
        2. Track two decisions over three days: where did you overshoot or fall short of the mean? What guided your calibration?
        3. Rewrite one of Aristotle’s examples (e.g., giving money) in a modern scenario (digital life, workplace, family).

        **Writing (250–300 words)**: Describe a habit you want to reshape. Using Book II, outline the training plan (actions, feelings, pleasures/pains to attend to).
